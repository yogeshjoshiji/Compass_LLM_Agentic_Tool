## Problem Statement <a name="problem-statement"></a>
Our ability to innovate and deliver value is increasingly constrained by inefficiencies in the development lifecycle and data access processes. Core engineering time is consumed by repetitive, manual tasks, while business users face barriers in retrieving actionable insights from enterprise data.

### Key Challenges

- **Engineering Drag**: Over **300 hours/month** are spent on repetitive test case creation. Code reviews lack consistency and depth‚Äî**40%** of GitHub PRs receive incomplete feedback, leading to lost knowledge and growing technical debt.

- **Data Access Bottlenecks**: **60%** of data-related queries require engineering intervention due to the absence of self-service tools or governed APIs. Meanwhile, developers lose **8+ hours/week** manually navigating siloed documentation across Confluence and SharePoint.

- **Manual Content Workflows**: Business and compliance teams spend substantial time summarizing and refining content, creating friction in internal processes and delays in regulatory documentation.

- **Governance & Compliance Risk**: As a regulated institution, we must ensure **every AI interaction is traceable**, **every customer record is protected**, and **no unauthorized data processing occurs**. Manual controls are not scalable or audit-friendly.

Without a scalable solution, these inefficiencies will continue to delay product delivery, inflate operational costs, and increase our exposure to compliance and audit risk.

**Regulatory Constraints**:  
- FFIEC-compliant audit trails for all AI-generated outputs  
- Strict PII controls (SSN, account numbers)

## Executive Summary
The **Enterprise AI Orchestration Platform** is designed to transform how developers, analysts, and business teams interact with code, data, and documents‚Äîby embedding trustworthy, auditable AI into everyday workflows.

This platform targets the root causes of delivery friction: repetitive engineering tasks, inaccessible data, ungoverned knowledge silos, and high compliance overhead.

### What It Delivers

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Empower business users to ask questions in plain English and receive compliant, PII-free SQL‚Äîvalidated before execution.
  
- **Automated Code Reviews**: Standardize GitHub pull request feedback and automatically raise Jira issues, reducing review gaps and preserving engineering knowledge.

- **AI-Powered Test Generation**: Convert Jira stories into Gherkin tests, mock data, and Playwright scripts‚Äîreducing manual QA effort by over 50%.

- **Unified Search Across Confluence & SharePoint**: Eliminate knowledge silos with semantic search and RAG-based document retrieval.

- **Intelligent Document Processing**: Automate text summarization and refactoring while maintaining traceability and regulatory guardrails.

### Technical Highlights

- Built with **LangChain + LangGraph** for agentic reasoning and audit-ready workflows  
- Integrated with **Qdrant** for secure, vectorized document and schema retrieval  
- Enforced with **FFIEC-aligned** audit logs and **PII redaction by default**  
- Modular, multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Azure, dbLLM) with enterprise observability

By combining modular AI capabilities with compliance-grade architecture, the platform enables faster delivery, lower costs, and stronger governance‚Äîunlocking innovation without sacrificing control.

## Solution Architecture
## Solution Options <a name="solution-options"></a>  

## Architecture Evaluation: Centralized vs. Standalone AI Services

We evaluated two architectural approaches for building the AI Orchestration Platform, balancing **speed of delivery** against the need for **centralized governance and consistency**.

---

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Standalone Agentic Services (‚úîÔ∏è Selected)

Each capability is built as a **self-contained microservice** that directly interacts with tools and LLMs. This modular approach focuses on rapid delivery of high-impact features.

**Architecture Flow:**
 
  User ‚Üí LangGraph Agent ‚Üí Qdrant ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Output 
 
**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ **Fast Time-to-Value**: First high-impact capability (NL-to-SQL) can go live within **4‚Äì6 weeks**
- ‚úÖ **Lower Complexity**: No need to build a centralized orchestration layer initially
- ‚úÖ **Targeted Governance**: Uses LangSmith and service-level controls for audit and safety, sufficient for initial scope

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå **Risk of Fragmentation**: Prompt templates and logic may diverge across services over time
- ‚ùå **Duplicated Logic**: Shared features like cost tracking or retries might be re-implemented in multiple services

---

### üèóÔ∏è Option 2: Centralized MCP (Model Context Protocol) Architecture

A centralized MCP server acts as a broker for all AI interactions, enforcing global policies, prompt versioning, and governance.

**Architecture Flow:**

User ‚Üí MCP ‚Üí LangChain ‚Üí Qdrant ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Output 

**Pros:**

- ‚úÖ **Centralized Governance**: Unified point for prompt management, policy enforcement, cost control, and observability
- ‚úÖ **Consistent UX**: Ensures that all AI features across teams follow a common standard

**Cons:**

- ‚ùå **Delayed Delivery**: Adds **8‚Äì10 weeks** to build the MCP before delivering any business value
- ‚ùå **Higher Complexity**: Introduces an additional architectural layer and potential single point of failure
- ‚ùå **Premature Abstraction Risk**: May build a generic platform that doesn‚Äôt map well to real-world use cases

---

### üß≠ Decision Rationale: Why We Chose Standalone Services

We selected **Option 1: Standalone Agentic Services** to prioritize **speed, agility, and validated learning**.

This approach allows us to:

- Deliver measurable business value **within weeks**, not quarters
- Start solving real user problems while keeping compliance and auditability in check
- Avoid the risk of overengineering upfront

While a centralized MCP-based architecture may offer long-term advantages, building it now would **delay impact** and **increase risk**. We will **reassess the need for a centralized orchestration layer in 12 months**, based on adoption, usage patterns, and governance needs.
